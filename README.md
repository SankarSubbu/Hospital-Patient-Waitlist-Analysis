# Hospital-Patient-Waitlist-Analysis

**Problem Statement**
Hospital management needs a comprehensive analysis of the patient wait list to optimize resource allocation, identify areas for improvement, and ensure efficient patient care. They require insights into the distribution of case types, age profiles, and specialty-wise wait times to make informed decisions.

**Steps followed**
<b>1. Data Collection and Preparation </b>
Gathered data on patient waiting lists from hospitals from 2018-2021, which includes Inpatient list and Outpatient list.
A Patient who stays in hospital while under treatment is Inaptient.
A Patient who receives medical treatment without being admitted to a hospital is are Outpatient.
And this data has been gathered on patient wait lists including case type, age, specialty, and wait times for the latest and previous months.

<b>2. Dashboard Design</b>
Created two dashboard slides, one for summary and the other for detailed view.

1. Included key performance indicators (KPIs) displaying the latest month's patient wait list count and the count from the previous month.
2. Implemented filters for average and median to provide flexibility in data analysis in the following charts.
   * Donut Chart: Shows the distribution of the different case types (Inpatient, Daycase, Outpatient).
   * Bar Chart: Displays the age profile distribution across different time bands.
   * Multi-row card: Highlights the top 5 waiting list specialties.
3. Line Chart: Shows the Monthly trend analysis of Day case, Inpatient, and Outpatient.

4. Created this detailed table showing the count of specialities, inpatients, and day cases according to different age profiles and time bands.

**Key Insights**
1. <b>Page 1 (Summary)</b>
* The KPIs provide a quick overview of current and previous months' patient waitlist counts across different specialists, which allows us to compare and see trend analysis.
* Donut chart highlights the proportion of each case type, aiding in proper resource allocation and capacity planning accordingly.
* Bar chart shows age distribution with different time bands, informing targeted service improvements.
* Multi-row card identifies the top 5 specialties with the highest wait times, guiding prioritization of interventions.

2. <b>Page 2 (Detailed View)</b>
* The detailed table provides deeper analysis on which allows stakeholders to identify which of those are performing best and worst in each of them, like specialities, age groups, and time bands.
* Trends in case type distribution across specialties provide insights into patient demographics and healthcare utilization patterns.
* Comparison of wait times for different case types aids in identifying bottlenecks and optimizing patient flow.

**Conclusion**
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view and analysis of Hospital Patient Waiting list, which empowers hospital management to make data-driven decisions that can reduce waiting time and other bottlenecks, optimizing resources, and improving patient care. By using these insights from Summary and Detailed View stakeholders can prioritize interventions, streamline processes, and ensure timely access to healthcare services for patients.
